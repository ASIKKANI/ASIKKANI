### 👨‍💻 About Me

[cite_start]I am a second-year B.Tech undergraduate specializing in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at VIT Chennai[cite: 6]. [cite_start]My true focus lies in Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and designing Large Language Model-based systems[cite: 6]. 

[cite_start]I am currently an AI Intern at Adrig AI, a role I secured after winning first place in the Dataset 2 Hackathon[cite: 15, 16, 17]. [cite_start]I thrive on rapidly prototyping ideas, reasoning about model limitations, and translating complex technical outputs into clear, human-centered explanations[cite: 8, 9]. While my core expertise is in AI software, I also have a growing interest in how AI integrates with hardware systems.

* [cite_start]🔭 **Currently Building:** Interpretable AI applications, LLM pipelines, and autonomous agents[cite: 7, 36].
* [cite_start]🧠 **Technical Focus:** Machine Learning fundamentals, NLP pipelines, prompt engineering, and overcoming complex model overfitting without relying on pre-trained architectures[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]🏆 **Recent Achievement:** Winner of the Dataset 2 Hackathon (First Prize)[cite: 31].

### 🚀 Featured Projects

* **[medi_report_analyser] | *Hackathon Winning Product***
  A hybrid AI medical report intelligence platform featuring local OCR, explainable insights, and an accessibility-first design. It extracts key medical values to generate clear, patient-friendly explanations, focusing strictly on interpretability[cite: 23, 24].
* **[Defy] | *Autonomous Agent***
  An MCP-powered autonomous AI trading agent that executes crypto trades via smart contracts. It logs every decision on-chain to ensure full transparency, auditability, and trustless AI-Web3 integration.
* **[Weather-classifier-aws-competion] | *Deep Learning***
  A custom Squeeze-and-Excitation ResNet (SE-ResNet) built entirely from scratch to classify weather conditions under severe domain shift. I focused heavily on analyzing and overcoming overfitting failures without using pre-trained models, achieving a Top 4 finish with a 0.719 F1-Score.
* **[AI That Explains Why It Can't Answer] | *LLM System***
  [cite_start]Designed an LLM-based system that explains failed assumptions and missing inputs rather than producing generic refusals, encouraging epistemic humility and transparency in AI[cite: 25, 26, 27].

### 💼 Experience

* **AI Intern @ Adrig AI** | *Current*
  [cite_start]Working on applied AI problem statements involving dataset analysis, modeling logic, and system-level reasoning in a fast-paced startup environment[cite: 16, 18, 19].
